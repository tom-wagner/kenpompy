# kenpompy - Basketball for Nerds

This python package serves as a convenient web scraper for [kenpom.com](kenpom.com), which provides tons of great NCAA basketball statistics and metrics. It **requires a subscription to Ken Pomeroy's site for use**, otherwise only the home page will be accessible. It's a small fee for a year of access, and totally worth it in my opinion.

## Objective
Ultimately, this package is to allow both hobbyist and reknown sports analysts alike to get data from kenpom in a format more suitable for visualization, transformation, and additional analysis. It's meant to be simple, easy to use, and to yield information in a way that is immediately usable.

## Responsible Use
As with many web scrapers, the responsibility to use this package in a reasonable manner falls upon the user. Don't be a jerk and constantly scrape the site a thousand times a minute or you run the risk of potentially getting barred from it, which you'd likely deserve. I am in no way responsible for how you use (or abuse) this package. Be sensible.

## But I Use R
Yeah, yeah, but have you heard of [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)? It's an R interface to python that also supports passing objects (like dataframes!) between them.

## Installation
`kenpompy` is easily installed via `pip`:

```
pip install kenpompy
```

## What It Can (and Can't) Do
This a work in progress - it can currently scrape all of the summary, FanMatch, and miscellaneous tables, pretty much all of those under the Stats and Miscellany headings. `Team` and `Player` classes are planned, but they're more complicated and will take some time.

## Usage
`kenpompy` is simple to use. Generally, tables on each page are scraped into `pandas` dataframes with simple parameters to select different seasons or tables. As many tables have headers that don't parse well, some are manually altered to a small degree to make the resulting dataframe easier to interpret and manipulate. 

First, you must login:
```
from kenpompy.utils import login

# Returns an authenticated browser that can then be used to scrape pages that require authorization.
browser = login(your_email, your_password)
```

Then you can request specific pages that will be parsed into convenient dataframes:
```
import kenpompy.summary as kp

# Returns a pandas dataframe containing the efficiency and tempo stats for the current season (https://kenpom.com/summary.php).
eff_stats = kp.get_efficiency(browser)
```
